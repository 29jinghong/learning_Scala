Scala 

=============================================================
Chapter 1
Scala is an acoronym for scalable lange 
it is statically typed - have type for varible stored, and can't be changed
it is also functional and object oriented
Scala is really good with fusion functional and object oriented 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Object Oriented Programing

all but the most trivial programs need some sort of structure.
trivial(琐碎的)

For instance, many languages admit values that are not objects, such as the primitive values in Java
(The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functional programming is guided by two main ideas.

1)
The first idea is that functions are first-class values.
In a functional language, a function is a value of the same status as
, say, an integer or a string. 
You can pass func- tions as arguments to other functions
, return them as results from functions, or store them in variables.
You can also define a function inside another function
, just as you can define an integer value inside a function.

2)
The second main idea of functional programming is 
that the operations of a program should map input values to output values 
rather than change data in place.

Immutable data structures are one of the cornerstones of functional programming.
Scala has immutable lists, tuples, maps, and sets. Which Java don't have.

Another way of stating this second idea of functional programming.
is that methods should not have any side effects

Methods like that is called referentially transparent

imperative style
is what programming with mutable data and side effects is called
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SBT
is an open source build tool for Scala and Java projects
is used to compile and run Scala

Data types

bit - (a bit is a single zero or one)
unicode -(unicode is an international character encoding standard 
that provides a unique number for every character across languages and scripts,)
signed value -

Byte -  can hold Value from -128 to 127 (8-bit signed value).
Char - can hold a single human readable character (16-bit unsigned unicode character).
Short - can hold Value from -32768 to 32767 (16-bit signed value).
Int - can hold value from -32768 to 32767 (16-bit signed value).
Long - can gold value from -2^63 to (2^63)-1 (64-bit signed value)
Booleans - can assign either true or false.
Float - can store real numbers (32-bite single-precision float)


question for this week:
in Scala a function value is an object(pg35)
that in this way the simplest object has the same construction principle as a full computer(pg35)
every value is an object and every operation is a method call(pg36)
method implementation(pg36)
creating new control structures(pg37)
name-less function literals & first-class nested functions(pg37)

what is signed value
what is single-precision float
